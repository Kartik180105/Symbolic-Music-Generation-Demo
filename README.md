# Symbolic Music Generation - Demo Samples

This repository contains demonstration outputs generated using symbolic music models discussed in our paper:

**"A Multistage Pipeline for Generating Symbolic Music with Deep Learning Architectures"**

## ðŸŽ¹ Simple Model Snippets

These short examples (10â€“20 seconds) demonstrate musical outputs generated using individual deep learning models:

| File                            | Model        | Description                            |
|---------------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| transformer_sample.mid          | Transformer  | Polyphonic, long-term structure        |
| vae_emotion_blend.mid           | VAE          | Emotion-conditioned stylistic blend    |
| gan_creative_motif.mid          | GAN          | Experimental and novel textures        |
| lstm_classical_chorale.mid      | LSTM         | Harmonically constrained chorale       |

Find them in the `simple-snippets/` folder.

## ðŸŽ¼ Full-Length AI Compositions

We also include two full-length compositions (~3 minutes each), automatically generated and arranged using advanced models:

- `ai_composition_1.mid`  
- `ai_composition_2.mid`

These can be found in the `full-compositions/` folder and demonstrate the real-world potential of symbolic AI generation.
